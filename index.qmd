I am an applied quantitative researcher specializing in education research, sociolinguistics, and data science. I worked at [McREL International](https://mcrel.org) from 2018–2025 and was the Applied Research Lead for the Institute of Education Sciences' [Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Pacific](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/regional-educational-laboratories-rel/pacific). 

I have a PhD in linguistics from the [University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/linguistics/).

My research has focused on variety of topics including teacher preparation in [Palau](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/teacher-certification-retention-and-recruitment-palau-understanding-graduation-patterns-teacher) and [Guåhan](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/using-high-school-and-college-data-predict-teacher-candidates-performance-praxis-unibetsedat-guahan); college readiness of high school students in [Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/using-high-school-data-explore-early-college-success-pohnpei-federated-states-micronesia), [Guåhan](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/using-high-school-data-predict-college-readiness-and-early-college-success-guahan-guam), the [Republic of the Marshall Islands](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/demographic-and-academic-characteristics-associated-college-readiness-and-early-college-success), and [Palau](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/using-high-school-data-predict-college-success-palau); social-emotional learning of high school student in [CNMI](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/descriptive-study/associations-between-high-school-students-social-emotional-competencies-and-their-high-school-and); language attitudes on [Pohnpei](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/items/b7e90920-fe07-4fdd-a9d3-0058b3843cf8); and [topological relations in Pohnpeian](http://hdl.handle.net/10125/63283). 

Outside of my research, I have led several technical assistance projects on education language policy, Indigenous language instruction, Indigenous culture education, instructional models, systemic change, teacher and principal professional learning, and data-informed decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy nature photography, especially macro photography. Check out some of my photography on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/bradleyrentz).
