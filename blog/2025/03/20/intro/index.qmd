Welcome to my new blog! Now that I am about to be unemployed, thanks to DOGE cutting all of my research funding, I decided to return to making periodic blog posts. My posts will mostly focus on R coding, statistics, and whatever research projects I'm currently working on. The posts will be written in a mostly tutorial-like fashion, so that you can follow along with the code and data that I'm using.
