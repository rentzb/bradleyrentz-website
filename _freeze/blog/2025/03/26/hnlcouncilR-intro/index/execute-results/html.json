Despite that, local government issues often get less attention than federal and state ones. Many people do not know what their local elected officials are doing and what measures (bills and resolutions) they are considering. To help increase transparency, I created a new R package, [`hnlcouncilR`](https://rentzb.github.io/hnlcouncilR/), to make it easier to see what measures the Honolulu City Council, my local city council, have voted on and are currently considering. The package can be installed from GitHub using `pak::pak(\"rentzb/hnlcouncilR\")`.\n\nIn this blog post, I demonstrate how to use the `hnlcouncilR` package and provide some sample analyses to show what can be done with it. \n\n\nTo get started we will be using these packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(hnlcouncilR)     # package for downloading HNL City Council data\nlibrary(tidyverse)       # ggplot, dplyr, %>%, and friends\nlibrary(janitor)         # data cleaning tools\nlibrary(kableExtra)      # for displaying tables\nlibrary(DT)              # for interactive tables\nlibrary(ggokabeito)      # for color palettes\n\n\n# Custom ggplot theme to make pretty plots\n# Get the News Cycle font at https://fonts.google.com/specimen/News+Cycle\ntheme_clean <- function() {\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"News Cycle\") +\n    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n          axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n          strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1), hjust = 0),\n          strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\", color = NA),\n          legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n}\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n# How `hnlcouncilR` works\n\nThe `hnlcouncilR` package downloads data for selected measures from the [Honolulu City Council's website](https://hnldoc.ehawaii.gov/hnldoc) using the `rvest` package and then reformats them into a tibble that can be used for other analysis. The main function of the package is `get_council_measures()`. To use it, we pick a measure to start with and a measure to end with. The function will attempt to download all measures in that range. Unfortunately, the measure's number that we need to use does not correspond to its actual measure name or number, but is rather a sequential number only used on the council's website. To determine the measure's number, search for the measure and then look at its url. For example the first measure of 2025 is RES25-001 and it has a url of https://hnldoc.ehawaii.gov/hnldoc/measure/3163. The four digit number in the url, 3163, is the measure number that we need to use. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# download a few sample measures\nsample_measures <- get_council_measures(start_measure = 3163,\n                                        end_measure = 3165)\nsample_measures %>%\n  head() %>%\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|measure_number |measure_name                                                                                                                                  |measure_type |measure_introducer1  |measure_introducer2 |event_date |event_type |event_description                             |AYES                                                                                |NOES |ABSENT                  | vote_ayes_n| vote_no_n| absent_n|introduced_by_request |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:-----------------------|-----------:|---------:|--------:|:---------------------|\n|RES25-001      |ADOPTING THE FINAL OʻAHU VISION ZERO ACTION PLAN DATED AUGUST 2024.                                                                           |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-02 |INTRO      |Introduced.                                   |NA                                                                                  |NA   |NA                      |           0|         0|        0|NO                    |\n|RES25-001      |ADOPTING THE FINAL OʻAHU VISION ZERO ACTION PLAN DATED AUGUST 2024.                                                                           |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-16 |PI&T       |Reported out for adoption.CR-20               |CORDERO, DOS SANTOS-TAM, OKIMOTO, TUPOLA, WEYER                                     |NA   |NA                      |           5|         0|        0|NO                    |\n|RES25-001      |ADOPTING THE FINAL OʻAHU VISION ZERO ACTION PLAN DATED AUGUST 2024.                                                                           |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-29 |CCL        |Committee report and Resolution were adopted. |CORDERO, DOS SANTOS-TAM, KIAʻĀINA, NISHIMOTO, OKIMOTO, TULBA, TUPOLA, WATERS, WEYER |NA   |NA                      |           9|         0|        0|NO                    |\n|RES25-002      |URGING THE HAWAIʻI STATE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-02 |INTRO      |Introduced.                                   |NA                                                                                  |NA   |NA                      |           0|         0|        0|NO                    |\n|RES25-002      |URGING THE HAWAIʻI STATE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-14 |HSEH       |Reported out for adoption.CR-6                |CORDERO, DOS SANTOS-TAM, TULBA, WEYER                                               |NA   |TUPOLA                  |           4|         0|        1|NO                    |\n|RES25-002      |URGING THE HAWAIʻI STATE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A UNIVERSAL FREE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. |resolution   |TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM |NA                  |2025-01-29 |CCL        |Committee report and Resolution were adopted. |CORDERO, KIAʻĀINA, NISHIMOTO, TULBA, TUPOLA, WATERS, WEYER                          |NA   |DOS SANTOS-TAM, OKIMOTO |           7|         0|        2|NO                    |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe function returns a tibble with one row per \"event\" for each of the measures within that range.

The non-voting events were removed from the data. This allows us to see how each member voted as the measures progressed. \n\nLet's now look at a more real example.\n\n# Honolulu City Council in 2024\n\nLet's see what the Honolulu City Council did in 2024. To do that, we need to download data for all measures between January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, since bills are given two years to be passed and measures are given 1 year. Our starting measure will be the first bill introduced in 2022, BILL001(22) which has measure number of 2056. The ending measure will be the last measure introduced in 2024, which is RES24-298, which is measure number 3162. We will then limit the data to only measures that had an event during the calendar year of 2024.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# download all data for 2024.

Among the measures not introduced by request, council chair Waters introduced the most resolutions and council member Dos Santos-Tam introduced the most bills. Council member Say introduced the fewest resolutions (and the fewest measures overall) and council members Tubla and Tupola each introduced the least number of bills.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmeasures_2024 %>%\n  filter(event_type == \"INTRO\") %>%\n  select(measure_number,measure_type,\n         measure_introducer1,measure_introducer2,\n         introduced_by_request) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = measure_introducer1:measure_introducer2, \n                 names_to = \"delete\", \n                 values_to = \"measure_introducer\",\n                 values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%\n    select(-delete) %>%\n  mutate(measure_introducer = case_when(\n    measure_introducer == \"TYLER DOS SANTOS-TAM\" ~ \"DOS SANTOS-TAM\",\n    .default = stringr::word(measure_introducer,-1))) %>%\n    group_by(measure_type,\n             measure_introducer,\n             introduced_by_request) %>%\n    count() %>%\n    mutate(introduced_by_request = case_when(\n      introduced_by_request == \"YES\" ~ \"By Request\",\n      introduced_by_request == \"NO\" ~ \"Not By Request\"\n    )) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(y = reorder(measure_introducer,n), x = n, color = measure_type)) +\n    geom_linerange(aes(y = measure_introducer,xmin=0,  xmax = n),\n                   position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +\n    geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +\n    facet_wrap(~introduced_by_request,scales = \"free\") + \n    theme_clean() +\n    scale_color_okabe_ito(name = \"\") +\n    theme(\n      panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Number of Measures Introduced (2024)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/measures-introduced-1.png){fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Which council members introduced measures together?\n\nMeasures in the Honolulu City Council can be introduced by either one or two council members. We can visualize how often each council member introduces measures with other members using the `cointro_network_graph()` function. Each line (or edge) represents a unique measure that was introduced by those two council members. \n\nOverall, council member Dos Santos-Tam introduced measures with 7 other council members (all except with council member Tupola). On the other hand, council member Say overall only introduced measures with two other members. \n\nThe network graphs all us to see patterns about who tended to work more often with whom. First there is the highly colloborative group, especially for bills, that comprises council members Dos Santos-Tam, Weyer, and Cordero. The next group is centered on council chair Waters. Waters cointroduced several bills with member Weyer and several resolutions with member Kiaʻāina, but Kiaʻāina and Weyer did not cointroduce measures together at all. Council members Tupola and Tulba form another group and most frequently introduced measures with each other, but occassionally worked with other highly collaborative members like Weyer.

For example, a no vote could be against deferring/postponing a measure (which is a vote in favor of the measures) or against specific amendments, which might change the nature of the measure. A member could also vote no on a measure in a committee, but ultimately vote yes on the measure in a full council meeting. Because of this, we will only look at each member's most recent no vote on each measure and exclude votes for postponing. I also include the description of that no vote and how many total council members voted no for additional context.\n\n### Cordero\nMember Cordero voted no on 4 measures in 2024.
